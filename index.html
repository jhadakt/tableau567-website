    <h1>Examining Student Alcohol Consumption</h1>
    <section id=intro> 
    <p>Drinking antics among youths and college-age adults seems is becoming increasingly common, dare I say a norm. Alcohol is a commonly abused substance among adults struggling with physical and emotional problems and addiction. The impact alcohol consumption can have on younger individuals is conceivably much more dangerous for a less developed, impressionable mind.</p>
    <h2>What You Can Learn</h2>
    <p>The purpose of this analysis is to identify determinants that intermingle with student alcohol consumption. In addition, distinguish inherent high risks situations. This investigation analyzes the information from the Student Alcohol Consumption dataset to depict patterns that may improve strategies to mitigate risks, monitor high-risk situations, and understand the relationship between student's environments and personal considerations. For this exploration data from 392 math students is evaluated.</p>

    <h2>How Age Affects Alcohol Consumption</h2>
    <p>I analyzed the Week day Alcohol consumption and Weekend Alcohol Consumption for math students across ages 15 to 22. I aggregated the age data to a single age year and used two stacked bar graphs to visualize weekend vs weekday. You can can click on an age in the legend and the graphs will highlight the age and transform the neighboring graph to display how these students responses across the other alcohol consumption attribute are distributed. Hovering over a segment will tell you the age, consumption level, and the number of students who fit this category.</p>

    <h2>Gender and Extracurriculars Comparison </h2>
    <p>I looked at the students who participate in extracurricular activities. Whether this impacts their study time depending on how much they participate in drinking. From the graph below, we can see that the average study time really does not fluctuate too much for both weekend and weekday drinking. It seems quite steady for both genders as well. However when you highlight a field it will tell you the number of students creating this average. It shows that these weekday sectors of high drinking are made  up of a very small group of people. Students involved in activities reach higher week end consumption levels meaning more people are averaging at this low study level. </p>

    <h2>How does Alcohol Consumption Affect Students Final Grades?</h2>
    <p>In this section I investigate the correlation between the final grades received by students in coordination with their tendencies to drink during the week and weekend. The top two visualizations independently show where students grades lie based on weekday drinking habits (on the left) and weekend alcohol consumption (on the right).</p>
    <p>While we can see those high levels of consumption tend to not reach those high scores, I decided to obtain insight on students who consistently maintain a consumption level. The third bar graph looks at only the students who consume the same during the week and weekend. Quickly we can see, while a smaller portion of students, heavy drinking regularly does not allow for any students to achieve the higher range of grade reflected academic performance.</p>

    <h2>How are High Consumption Levels Reflected in School?</h2>
    <p>To dig deeper into how high alcohol consumption levels can impact final grades I evaluated measures to see if there are trends in behavior regarding education that can be linked to alcohol consumption. To line graphs explore if students have failed classes and are absent from their schooling often.</p> 
    <p>Past class failures is numerical from 0 to 3 and absences are measured as an integer from 1 to 93. Both values are being totaled, hovering over a mark will show you how many students contributed to each total.</p>

  <section id="health" class="center-page">
    <h2>How is Health a part of this?</h2>
    <p>I analyzed health to determine how consumption may influence behavior or reflect behavior. One can assume that a person with poor health would refrain from alcohol. However there is also the possibility of the reverse, high consumption levels reflecting poor ratings of health. I decided to compared the categorical data against the number of absences. The previous graph shows a drop in attendance could be prevalent among heavy drinking students, but it may be possible to subgroup them even further.</p>
    <p>By interacting and selecting a marker on the line graph you can see the average absences of students across consumption and health. Where very bad health is rated as a 1 to great health, 5. Looking at the average number of absences we can deduce that at these high levels of drinking, regardless of their rating of their heath, students tend to be absent a lot more. Showing that these high drinking levels may have a negative impact on not how students may view their health but how it is influencing their overall well being and attendance for education.</p>
    <p>The pie chart details how much of those two highest levels contribute to absences, all other consumption levels are under other. Filter the chart to see an interestingly low percentage of students account for a large number of absences.</p>
